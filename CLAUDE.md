## Development Environment

### Primary Development Platform
- **Google Colab** (Recommended) - Pre-configured with most required packages
- Accessible at: https://colab.research.google.com/
- No local installation required

### Local Development (Optional)
For students preferring local development:
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook
```

### Required Python Version
- Python 3.9 or higher

## Key Dependencies

The bootcamp uses these core libraries:

### Data Science Stack
- **numpy** >= 1.21.0 - Numerical computing and arrays
- **pandas** >= 1.5.0 - Data manipulation and analysis
- **matplotlib** >= 3.5.0 - Data visualization
- **scipy** >= 1.9.0 - Scientific computing
- **seaborn** >= 0.11.0 - Statistical visualization

### Machine Learning
- **scikit-learn** >= 1.1.0 - Machine learning library
- **statsmodels** >= 0.13.0 - Statistical modeling

### Optimization
- **pyomo** >= 6.4.0 - Mathematical optimization modeling
- **plotly** >= 5.10.0 - Interactive visualizations
- **highspy** >= 1.5.0 - HiGHS optimization solver

### Optional Commercial Solvers (Academic Licenses)
- **gurobi** >= 11.0.0 - Commercial optimization solver
- **cplex** >= 22.1.0 - IBM CPLEX optimization solver

## Working with Notebooks

### Running Notebooks
Each notebook is self-contained and includes:
- Package installation checks and dependency management
- Comprehensive explanations with theory and practical applications
- Progressive hands-on exercises building from basics to advanced concepts
- Real-world examples using synthetic PhD student research productivity data
- Interactive practice problems themed around academic life and research scenarios
- Self-generating datasets (no external data files required)

### Notebook Execution Order
1. **Block 1**: Python fundamentals, programming paradigms, Google Colab mastery, basic syntax and functions
2. **Block 2**: NumPy arrays, comprehensive Pandas data wrangling, complete data cleaning pipeline with feature engineering
3. **Block 3**: Scikit-learn machine learning pipeline, linear regression, model evaluation, cross-validation, and prediction interpretation
4. **Block 4**: Pyomo optimization modeling, MILP formulation, solver comparison, real-world decision problems
5. **Block 5**: Git version control fundamentals, GitHub workflow, professional development practices

### Data Generation and Flow
- **Block 1**: Simple simulation datasets (inventory, coffee consumption, parking)
- **Block 2**: Comprehensive PhD student dataset with realistic messiness (missing values, duplicates, outliers)
- **Block 3**: Self-contained data pipeline that recreates Block 2's cleaned dataset for standalone use
- **Block 4**: Multiple optimization datasets (time allocation, course scheduling, campus routing)
- **Block 5**: Project-based data for version control practice
- All datasets generated programmatically - no external files needed

## Educational Context

### Target Audience
- Incoming PhD students in ISE and Operations Research
- All experience levels welcome (beginner to intermediate)
- Focus on research-relevant Python applications

### Learning Objectives
1. **Foundation Building**: Solid Python foundation for quantitative coursework
2. **Tool Introduction**: Modern computational tools for research productivity
3. **Practical Application**: Real problems and development workflows
4. **Research Integration**: Examples relevant to ISE/OR research domains

### Block Topics
- **Block 1**: Programming paradigms (compiled vs interpreted), Python ecosystem, Google Colab shortcuts, variables, data types, control flow, functions, inventory simulation, PhD life exercises
- **Block 2**: NumPy vectorized operations, Pandas DataFrame manipulation, comprehensive data cleaning (missing values, duplicates, outliers, categorical standardization), feature engineering, GroupBy operations
- **Block 3**: Machine learning fundamentals, scikit-learn workflow, linear regression theory, train-test split, model evaluation metrics, cross-validation, feature importance, prediction intervals, PhD productivity modeling

## Common Development Tasks

### Package Installation in Colab
Most packages are pre-installed, but if needed:
```python
!pip install package_name
```

### Data Persistence in Colab
For saving work between sessions:
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

### Running All Notebooks
Each notebook is independent but builds conceptually on previous blocks. Start with Block 1 for foundational concepts.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Colab Issues
- **Package not found**: Install using `!pip install package_name`
- **Runtime disconnected**: Reconnect via Runtime menu, re-run cells
- **Files not persisting**: Save to Google Drive using drive.mount()

### Local Installation Issues
- **Package installation fails**: Update pip with `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
- **Jupyter won't start**: Try `python -m jupyter notebook`
- **Dependencies conflict**: Consider using conda environment
