    "By the end of this block, you'll be able to:\n",
    "- Understand the fundamentals of Linear Programming and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming\n",
    "- Model real-world decision problems using Pyomo\n",
    "- Solve optimization problems with different solvers\n",
    "- Interpret solutions and make data-driven decisions\n",
    "- Appreciate the difference between open-source and commercial solvers\n",
